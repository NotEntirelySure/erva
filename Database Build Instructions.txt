#Enter the following command into the postgres SQL shell prompt:

CREATE DATABASE erva;
CREATE USER superuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'root';

#Log into the newly-created erva database with the following command:

\c erva;

#Now that you are connected to the erva database, you need assign premissions to the newly created superuser account. Enter the following commands to assign the permissions:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE erva TO superuser;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO superuser;

Now that the superuser has been grated premission, connect to the erva database as the super user with the following command:

\c erva superuser;

now that you're connected to the erva as superuser, the tables need to be created. To do this, you can copy and paste all of the database schema in one go
